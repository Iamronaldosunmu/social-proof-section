## My process
Built this website using the bottoms up approach- Built the components then assembled them for the final product. I also used the BEM system of naming classes.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### What I learned

I solidified my understanding of handling complex css layouts. It was also fun to use the css flex attribute once again.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I am currently learning User Interface design with Adobe XD so that I'll be able to make the designs I use in my projects from scratch. After that, I'll be learning React.js and React Native.
### Useful resources

- [The Ultimate Html and Css Course By mosh Hamedani](https://www.codewithmosh.com) - This taught me most of what I know in html and css (at the time of building this project).
